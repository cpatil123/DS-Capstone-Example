# DataScienceCapstone
Repository for JHU Coursera Data Science Capstone Project  

### Description  
This capstone project's aim is to delve into a previously unknown field within data science, namely **(NLP) Natural Language Processing**, and given a dataset of tweets, blog posts and news posts, we are required to clean and analyze the text in order to create a simple text prediction app using the `shiny` framework.
